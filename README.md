### 0. Documentation:
Well, this is like the 'Logger' module, I don't personally recomend it, but is better.

## 1. so... how i customize it??
very simple 'sugarheart' you will need to:
1.1 credit me (optional) 
1.2 please do 1.1
1.3 a brain
1.3 python > 3.10

- What do you want to add? automation to log?
to do automation you will need to import **library**, then you will get **libs** class.
when in **libs**, will have some functions, but the main one is the **miawlib(level)** level??? what is this!
don't worry! level is just when you call it '**libs.miawlib(level)**' level must be an obj or use the
**libs.miawlib(level='debug')** witch is a string.

- Add levels?
to add custom levels like '**libs.miawlib(level='newLevelYepy')**' the Main.py will recognize as a null level and
will not be funny :c
go to main.py, especially in **line 27, Col 0** press enter or make a new line, put 4 spaces, digit 'elif info == 'YOUR CUSTOM INFO LEVEL':
jump to new line, put 8 spaces now, digit 'result = 'YOUR CUSTOM MESSAGE''see? simple.

- How do I read Logs?
simple, you don't
just kidding, just execute main.py and follow what i told you in the terminal, like robbing a bank or drinking so much pepsi (what a punishment drink pepsi)
